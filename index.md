## Welcome to the Socialsquare Brandguide



**Introduction**

This guide helps anyone at Socialsquare create content that is in tune with Socialsquare’s brand and person. 
It contains a broader section on the tone and voice of our written material and a more focused section highlighting key elements of our written content. 
It is meant to be used for reference as needed when writing anything that is for an external purpose. 
Topics may be added as we go along and when we find that they are needed. 
While we currently write the majority of our external communication in Danish, this guide is written in English as it’s for internal purposes and should serve the entire Socialsquare team.
