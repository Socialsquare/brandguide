##Writing Email Newsletters

Every week Socialsquare send out a newsletter.  
The purpose of the newsletter is to provide relevant and interesting information to our community of digital professionals.  
The most common types of content are  
* Excerpts from our most recent blog post
* Event invitations
* Knowledge sharing from events we’ve held
* Links We Love Fridays

All email newsletters should follow the same template and contain these elements:  
* Logo at the top
* Hierarchically distributed content
* Call to action
* Contact bar
* Footer including social sharing, subscription preferences and contact information

*From name and email*  
This should always be Socialsquare and our general email. We also write as “we”.

*Subject line*  
Keep it short, descriptive and without sales lingo.

*Preheader text*  
This shows in the reader's inbox, after the subject line and should give a taste of what they can expect from the email.

*Hierarchy*  
Readers will skim emails. Use clear headings and put important content at the top. Make your call to actions clear. 

*Testing*  
Always test campaigns before sending them. Check that all links are pointing to the right directions, check your spelling and send the email to a coworker for a read through.
