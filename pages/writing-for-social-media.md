##Writing for Social Media

Make sure you refer to the section on voice and tone so your writing is consistent with Socialsquareâ€™s personality. 

###Ownerships of posts
all posts are sent from Socialsquare. We do not add initials or names to posts, but can tag team members in a post if it includes a personal point of view.

###Mentions and tags
Use appropriate mentions in a post, by tagging the account of the mentioned.  
Use relevant hashtags in post, but limit it to 3 per post.  
Whenever possible, run all links through Buffer to add tracking and link shortening.
