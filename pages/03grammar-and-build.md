**Basics**  
Write for every reader.  
Some of our readers will read every word of a text, some will just skim, looking for the highlights. Make it easy for both types to read your text and understand your take aways.  
To do this use descriptive headlines and subheaders in your text.   
Use bold or italics in your main text.  
Use bulleted lists.  
Make sure you group your ideas together in paragraphs instead of spreading them out in the text.  

**Focus**  
Use a hierarchical structure for your information. Lead with outlining the main points and then dive into the details. 

**Be concise**  
Cut the fluff and shorten your sentences. Be more Hemingway, less Tolkien. 

**Be clear**  
Donâ€™t use jargon and expect every reader to understand. Use a clear, simple language without talking down to your reader.

**Abbreviations**  
Unless it is a well known abbreviation, where the abbreviation itself is used in everyday speech rather than the full version, we spell out the full line of words. 
Examples of abbreviations used in everyday language could be API or HTML.

**Numbers**  
Be consistent. If there are more than one number in one paragraph, choose to either write it as numbers or to spell it out. 

_How to:_  
They completed two projects in ten days

_How not to:_  
They completed two projects in 10 days

**Punctuation**
Standard punctuation guides apply.  
We do not adhere by a specific comma rule, but if you are in doubt, read it out loud and notice your natural pauses.
Be careful with overusing hyphens ( - ). Usually a comma, full stop or colon will make the sentence easier to read. 

If in doubt, ask the content supporter for help with your text.
