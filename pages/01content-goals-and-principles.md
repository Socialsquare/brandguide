##Content Goals and Principles

We communicate with the purpose to guide, connect, challenge and enable our audience.

>***Guide***   
>We are transparent, open and honest about our ideas, methods and processes and happy to share them. We aim to guide our audience clearly through how we do what we do and to share our vision along the way.
>
>***Connect***  
>We share a close relationship with our clients and friends and want to empower the community around Socialsquare to grow. Our audience should feel like an important part of that community and as a friend of the house.
>
>***Challenge***  
>We are not afraid to challenge neither our readers nor the current solutions in place that are not leading toward an open, digital society. We hold an opinion and are happy to participate in a discussion about it.
>
>***Enable***  
>We enable our audience to use the methods and tools that we believe in and build upon them. We share our knowledge and believe that it makes our community stronger.
