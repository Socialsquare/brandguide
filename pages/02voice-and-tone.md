##Voice and tone in writing style

Any communication from Socialsquare should show excellence, openness and courage to challenge.  
It should be presented with a friendliness and straightforwardness that reflect Socialsquare’s open culture and personality. 

_We are clear and concise and without jargon._  
Be clear in your words and do not build unnecessary long sentences. They obscure your point and are difficult to read online. While details can be a colorful addition, do not use them unless they are crucial to the point you want to get across.  
Make every word tell. Be more Hemingway and less Tolkien.

_We are visionary but never arrogant._  
When we voice our opinions, some people will disagree with us. Indulge in the conversation with an open mind. 
Do not brag or boast cleverness, but present your points with arguments, reasoning and evidence instead of superlatives.

_We are conversational but not chatty._  
Expressions such as “haha”, “Surprise, surprise” and “:)” do not support our integrity.  
While we do have humor, we do not entertain for the sole purpose of doing so.  
Save the emoticons for Slack. 

_We are practical, challenging and opinionated, but never bossy._  
We are happy to share our methods, learnings and opinions with our readers, and encourage them to apply them in their own work.  
We challenge the current status if its needed and are not afraid to voice our opinion.   
We engage in conversations with our audience, but without telling them what to do. Feedback and questions make us better and are always welcome.  
When we discuss an issue we suggest a solution or at least a point of action to it.

_We keep our audience in mind_  
Digital professionals read Socialsquare’s blog, newsletters and other written content. Do not dumb down your content on their behalf. 
However, keep in mind that they come from a variety of different backgrounds, so define your terms and give relevant background information when needed.
